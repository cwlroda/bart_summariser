Syed Suhail Syed Zin, 44, is seeking judicial review of the Singapore Prison Service's decision to carry out the death sentence on him before those who were convicted before him. He contends this is a violation of his right to equality under the Constitution. His lawyer cited the case of Malaysian drug trafficker Datchinamurthy Kataiah, who was given the death penalty before Suh Hail in 2015. Chief Justice Sundaresh Menon said that on the face of it, there is an inconsistency between the known facts and an affidavit submitted to the court by the Ministry of Home Affairs. He added that flexibility has to be exercised in a way that is rational and fair.
