Daryati stabbed Madam Seow Kim Choo, 59, more than 90 times in June 2016. She initially faced the mandatory death penalty for murder, under Section 300(a) of the Penal Code. But in a twist last month, the conviction was quashed after Daryati withdrew her guilty plea in the hope of getting a lower sentence by relying on psychiatric evidence. The Indonesian, who said she was two years younger than her official age of 28, was taking the stand for the first time as her murder trial resumed. She testified that she wanted to return home less than two months after starting work in April, 2016 because she was worried about her family, who could not be contacted. She said she felt "very angry" with her employer for not allowing her to go home. However, she maintained that she had no intention to kill her employer.
