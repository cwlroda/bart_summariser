The Chief Justice has given the go-ahead for investigations into two Deputy Public Prosecutors. This follows a misconduct complaint by former domestic helper Parti Liyani. She was accused of stealing $34,000 worth of items from her former employer. The charge alleged that the 46-year-old Indonesian had stolen, among other things, a Pioneer DVD player. On appeal to the High Court, the DVD player was found to be faulty, and she was acquitted of all charges. In June, Ms Parti filed a complaint against DPPs Tan Yanying and DPP Tan Wee Hao. The high-profile case has sparked public outcry, with questions raised about the way in which the trial was conducted. Reviews by the police and the Attorney-Generalâ€™s Chambers are expected to conclude this month. Law and Home Minister Kam Shanmugam has said he intends to make a ministerial statement in Parliament next month to address the questions raised in the case. The conviction was overturned by High Court on Sept 4, 2018. She appealed against her conviction in a three-day hearing that took place between November last year and August this year. The complaint was filed against the DPP's in June.
